# Data setup

```{r}
# Initialize a temporary in memory database
con <- dbConnect(SQLite(), ":memory:")

# Download tables
actor <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivanceras/sakila/master/csv-sakila-db/actor.csv")
rental <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivanceras/sakila/master/csv-sakila-db/rental.csv")
customer <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivanceras/sakila/master/csv-sakila-db/customer.csv")
payment <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivanceras/sakila/master/csv-sakila-db/payment_p2007_01.csv")

# Copy data.frames to database
dbWriteTable(con, "actor", actor)
dbWriteTable(con, "rental", rental)
dbWriteTable(con, "customer", customer)
dbWriteTable(con, "payment", payment)
dbListTables(con)
```

```{sql, connection=con, output.var = "x1"}
PRAGMA table_info(actor)
```

```{r}
x1
```

```{sql, connection=con}
PRAGMA table_info(actor)
```

```{r}
dbGetQuery(con,"
      PRAGMA table_info(actor)
           "
)
```


# Exercise 1

Retrieve the actor ID, first name and last name for all actors using the actor table. Sort by last name and then by first name.

```{r}
dbGetQuery(con,"
SELECT   actor_id, first_name, last_name
FROM    actor
ORDER by last_name, first_name
LIMIT 15
           ")
```

Try in SQL directly:

```{sql, connection=con}
SELECT   actor_id, first_name, last_name
FROM    actor
ORDER by last_name, first_name
```

# Exercise 2

Retrive the actor ID, first name, and last name for actors whose last name equals ‘WILLIAMS’ or ‘DAVIS’.

```{r}
dbGetQuery(con,"
SELECT   actor_id, first_name, last_name
FROM    actor
WHERE last_name IN ('WILLIAMS', 'DAVIS')
ORDER BY last_name
")
```

# Exercise 3

Write a query against the rental table that returns the IDs of the customers who rented a film on July 5, 2005 (use the rental.rental_date column, and you can use the date() function to ignore the time component). Include a single row for each distinct customer ID.

```{r}
dbGetQuery(con,"
      PRAGMA table_info(rental)
           "
)
```


```{r}
dbGetQuery(con,"
SELECT DISTINCT customer_id, rental_date
FROM  rental
WHERE date(rental_date) = '2005-07-05'
")
```

```{r}
#dbGetQuery(con,"
#SELECT customer_id, 
#     COUNT(*) AS N
#FROM  rental
#WHERE date(rental_date) = '2005-07-05'
#GROUP BY customer_id
#")
```

# Exercise 4

Construct a query that retrieves all rows from the payment table where the amount is either 1.99, 7.99, 9.99.

```{r}
dbGetQuery(con,"
      PRAGMA table_info(payment)
")
```

```{r}
dbGetQuery(con,"
SELECT *
FROM payment
WHERE amount IN (1.99, 7.99, 9.99)
LIMIT 10
  ")
```

## 4.2

Construct a query that retrieves all rows from the payment table where the amount is greater than 5

```{r}
dbGetQuery(con,"
SELECT *
FROM payment
WHERE amount > 5
LIMIT 10
")
```

Greater than 5 and less than 8

```{r}
dbGetQuery(con,"
SELECT *
FROM payment
WHERE amount > 5   AND amount < 8
LIMIT 10
")
```

# Exercise 5

Retrive all the payment IDs and their amount from the customers whose last name is ‘DAVIS’.

```{r}
dbGetQuery(con,"
      PRAGMA table_info(customer)
")
```

```{r}
dbGetQuery(con,"
SELECT c.customer_id, c.last_name, p.payment_id, p.amount
FROM customer AS c INNER JOIN payment AS p
  ON c.customer_id = p.customer_id
 WHERE c.last_name == 'DAVIS' 
/* WHERE c.last_name == 'DAVIS' */  /* This is a comment*/
  ")
```

# Exercise 6

## 6.1
Count the number of records in rental

```{r}
dbGetQuery(con,"
SELECT  COUNT(*) AS count
FROM  rental
")
```


## 6.2

Use COUNT(*) and GROUP BY to count the number of rentals for each customer_id

```{r}
dbGetQuery(con,"
SELECT  customer_id, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM  rental
GROUP BY customer_id
LIMIT 8
")
```

## 6.3

Sort in descending order

```{r}
dbGetQuery(con,"
SELECT  customer_id, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM  rental
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY count DESC
LIMIT 8
")
```

## 6.4

Repeat the previous query but use HAVING to only keep the groups with 40 or more.

```{r}
dbGetQuery(con,"
SELECT  customer_id, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM  rental
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING count >= 40
ORDER BY count DESC
LIMIT 8
")
```

# Exercise 7

The following query calculates a number of summary statistics for the payment table using MAX, MIN, AVG and SUM
```{r}
dbGetQuery(con,"
SELECT MAX(amount) AS maxpayment,
       MIN(amount) AS minpayment,
       AVG(amount) AS avgpayment,
       SUM(amount) AS sumpayment
FROM payment
")
```

## 7.1  Modify the above query to do those calculations for each customer_id
```{r}
dbGetQuery(con,"
SELECT customer_id,
       MAX(amount) AS maxpayment,
       MIN(amount) AS minpayment,
       AVG(amount) AS avgpayment,
       SUM(amount) AS sumpayment
FROM payment
GROUP BY customer_id
LIMIT 5
")
```

## 7.2  do those calculations for each customer_id and save those for customers with more than 5 records
```{r}
dbGetQuery(con,"
SELECT customer_id,
       COUNT(*)    AS  N,
       MAX(amount) AS maxpayment,
       MIN(amount) AS minpayment,
       AVG(amount) AS avgpayment,
       SUM(amount) AS sumpayment
FROM payment
GROUP BY customer_id 
HAVING N>5
")  
```


```{r}
# clean up
dbDisconnect(con)
```
